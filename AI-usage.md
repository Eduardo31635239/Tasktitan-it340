# AI Usage Disclosure

I used AI assistance (Grok by xAI) throughout the project for the following:

- Troubleshooting VM networking issues (Host-Only VLAN, SSH between VMs, /etc/hosts configuration)
- Fixing Nginx reverse proxy configuration and path stripping issues
- Generating and debugging backend server.js code (Express routes, JWT auth, MFA with otplib, MongoDB connection)
- Creating frontend HTML/JS for login, register, dashboard with drag-and-drop task status change
- Writing monitor.sh script for Administrator VM
- Guidance on MongoDB installation and binding to VLAN
- General debugging of errors (CORS, 404, require vs import)

All code was reviewed, understood, and modified by me to fit the project requirements.

No AI was used to generate the overall architecture — the 4-VM MEAN deployment, VLAN setup, and separation were my own implementation based on course materials.
